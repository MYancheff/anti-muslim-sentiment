Our data
--------

State-level data on religiously-motivated anti-Muslim hate crimes is available from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program. On April 23, 1990, Congress passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act, 28 U.S.C. § 534, which required the Attorney General to collect data “about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.” Utilizing voluntary information from thousands of local and state law enforcement agencies, the UCR Program created a hate crime data collection to comply with the congressional mandate.

In 2013, the Director of the FBI expanded the bias types in the religion category of reported hate crimes to include all of those identified by the Pew Research Center and the U.S. Census Bureau. The director also approved the collection of an anti-Arab bias. Beginning in 2015, law enforcement agencies could submit the following additional religious bias types: anti-Buddhist, anti-Eastern Orthodox (Greek, Russian, etc.), anti-Hindu, anti-Jehovah’s Witness, anti-Mormon, anti-other Christian, and anti-Sikh. Furthermore, the Hate Crime Statistics Program began collecting race and ethnicity bias types under the combined category Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry, which includes the added bias type of anti-Arab.

The official reports filed with the FBI are regarded as the “best source of national hate crime data,” and they are used commonly by researchers analyzing hate crimes. Hate crimes include murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation, robbery, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, destruction, damage, vandalism, and crimes against society (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2012).

Variables (controls, etc)
-------------------------

Control for severity of crime? Where crime occurs?

Temporal clustering?

Population density of Muslims?

Base crime level in county (or other region?)

Rates of other hate crimes (anti-LGBT, etc.)

Partisanship

Perhaps relevant policies in the region (anti-hate crime)?
Education levels in the county?

Mini literature review
----------------------

While there is a breadth of literature in sociology and political science on potential causes of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the US and UK, there are few studies that actually attempt to find the causes and correlates of hate crimes in the US using statistical analysis. Levy (2017) proposes that “legal inequalities increase hate crimes because they provide discursive opportunities for bias, discrimination, and violence,” and focuses on anti-LGBT hate crimes specifically. Using annual panel data from 2000 to 2012, Levy analyzes how three state policies affect reported hate crimes: same-sex partnerships, employment non-discrimination, and hate crime laws, and concludes that hate crime incidence is may be spatially correlated, as “policy changes in one state yield spillover benefits in other states.” These results of Levy’s study provide some of the first quantitative evidence that public policies affect hate crimes rates.

The majority of the existing literature on specifically anti-Muslim hate crimes lacks an empirical exploration of potential causes. Frost (2008) provides a similar argument that British government policies affect the incidence of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the UK by cultivating a “climate of hostility” towards Muslim communities, yet provides a mostly theoretical basis for the argument and does not construct a statistical analysis for her claims. Poynting and Perry (2007) construct a comparative analysis of anti-Muslim hate crimes in Canada and Australia, contextualizing “the anti-Muslim vilification and victimisation within parallel - yet still distinct - political climates that bestow permission to hate.” Poynting and Perry argue that “negative media portrayals, together with discriminatory rhetoric, policy and practices at the level of the state create an enabling environment that signals the legitimacy of public hostility toward the Muslim communities.” However, their paper lacks any kind of empirical or statistical analysis of data on anti-Muslim hate crimes.

King and Sutton (2013) provide one of the few studies of religiously motivated hate crimes that utilize statistical modelling. Hypothesizing that many hate crimes are retaliatory in nature and tend to increase dramatically in the aftermath of an event, they find that contentious trial verdicts and lethal terrorist attacks “precede spikes in racially or religiously motivated hate crimes.” Kaplan (2006) provided a clear-cut example of the effects of external threats on hate crime. Using FBI statistics, he showed a sharp spike in Islamophobic hate crime in the US immediately following the terrorist attacks in September 2001. Green et al. (1998) found correlations between demographic change (mainly rate of influx of ethnic minorities to predominantly white neighbourhoods) and hate crime incidents. Grattet (2009) has a similar finding. However, for Green et al. (1998), correlations between economic deprivation (for example, income levels, unemployment) and hate crime are less evident. Karapin (1998) comes establishes a statistical link between German politicians’ hostile statements toward asylum seekers and subsequent upsurges in racist violence in the ‘90s.

There is little to no empirical literature on the effect of media on hate crime incidence in the United States. However, there have been several European studies on media analyses of hate crime incidences. The German hate crime wave in the 1990s prompted media content analysis in an attempt to provide empirical explanations for hate crime incidences. Green et al. 2001 writes that “Temporal clustering in hate crime incidents suggest that media coverage created a contagion of xenophobic violence if not a climate favorable to its initial outburst.” Brosius & Eps (1995) provide a content analysis of two German newspapers to show that coverage of anti-refugee hate crimes did shape and distort the media reporting of subsequent events. However, Green et al. 2001 writes: “The very complexity of the causal processes that these media content analyses purport to describe, however, means that they can at best establish some media responsibility for the propagation of xenophobic violence. They cannot isolate the causal weight of factors as divergent as the cultural meanings encoded in mediated messages and the social and psychological conditions of those who receive them and translate them into action.”
